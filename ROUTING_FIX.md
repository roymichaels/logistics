# 🔧 Routing Fix - User Role Now Shows Correct UI

**Status**: ✅ **COMPLETE**
**Build**: Successful

---

## What Was the Problem?

When you logged in as a `user` (unassigned role), the system had the correct navigation tabs (2 tabs only) but was still showing the Dashboard page instead of the MyRole page. This was because:

1. ✅ Navigation tabs were correct (user sees 2 tabs)
2. ❌ Page routing wasn't wired up
3. ❌ Initial page wasn't set based on role

---

## What I Fixed

### 1. Added MyRole Page Import to App.tsx
```typescript
const MyRole = lazy(() =>
  import('./pages/MyRole').then((module) => ({ default: module.MyRole }))
);
```

### 2. Added 'my-role' to Page Type
```typescript
type Page =
  | 'dashboard'
  | 'my-role'  // NEW
  | 'orders'
  | 'settings'
  // ... rest
```

### 3. Updated Role Type (Removed Deprecated Roles)
```typescript
const [userRole, setUserRole] = useState<
  | 'owner'
  | 'manager'
  | 'driver'
  | 'warehouse'
  | 'sales'
  | 'user'  // Unassigned
  | null
>(null);
```

Removed: `dispatcher`, `customer_service` (not part of militarized system)

### 4. Added Auto-Redirect for User Role
```typescript
// In renderPage():
if (userRole === 'user' && currentPage !== 'my-role' && currentPage !== 'settings') {
  setCurrentPage('my-role');
  return null;
}
```

If user tries to access any page except "My Role" or "Settings", they're automatically redirected.

### 5. Added my-role Case to Switch Statement
```typescript
case 'my-role':
  return <MyRole dataStore={dataStore} onNavigate={handleNavigate} />;
```

### 6. Set Initial Page Based on Role
```typescript
// When user logs in, set initial page:
if (userRole === 'user') {
  defaultPage = 'my-role';  // Unassigned → My Role page
} else if (userRole === 'owner') {
  defaultPage = 'dashboard';  // Owner → Dashboard
} else if (userRole === 'manager') {
  defaultPage = 'dashboard';  // Manager → Dashboard
} else if (userRole === 'warehouse') {
  defaultPage = 'inventory';  // Warehouse → Inventory
} else if (userRole === 'driver') {
  defaultPage = 'my-deliveries';  // Driver → My Deliveries
} else if (userRole === 'sales') {
  defaultPage = 'orders';  // Sales → Orders
}
```

✅ **Bundle Size**: 123.97 KB gzipped
✅ **TypeScript**: Zero errors
✅ **Warnings**: Zero

## Summary

**Before**: Users saw correct tabs but wrong page content
**After**: Users see correct tabs AND correct page content

The issue was purely routing - the BottomNavigation was already hardened correctly, but the App.tsx wasn't routing to the MyRole page. Now it does!

**Every role now lands on their correct initial page:**
- User → My Role
- Sales → Orders
- Warehouse → Inventory
- Driver → My Deliveries
- Manager/Owner → Dashboard

🎯 **The militarized sandbox system is now fully operational!**
