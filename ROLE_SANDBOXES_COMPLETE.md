## 🔑 Manager Login System

### Environment Variable
Add to `.env`:
```bash
VITE_ADMIN_PIN=000000  # Change this in production!
```

### How It Works
1. Unassigned user clicks "🔐 Request Manager Access"
2. Modal appears with 6-digit PIN entry
3. User enters PIN (max 3 attempts)
4. On success: User role updated to 'manager'
5. On failure: 5-minute lockout after 3 failed attempts

### PIN Entry Features
- 6 individual input boxes (mobile-friendly)
- Auto-focus next box on digit entry
- Backspace navigation
- Rate limiting (3 attempts, 5 min cooldown)
- Countdown timer during lockout
- Haptic feedback on success/error

### Production Security
- PIN stored in environment variable (not hardcoded)
- Failed attempts logged
- Cooldown prevents brute force
- Optional: Send Telegram notification to platform owner on promotion
