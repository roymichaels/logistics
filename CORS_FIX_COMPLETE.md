# CORS Preflight Fix Complete

## Problem
User role changes were failing with the error:
```
Access to fetch at 'https://drfpzclnutdldwomfsfz.supabase.co/functions/v1/set-role' 
from origin 'https://thebull.dog' has been blocked by CORS policy: 
Response to preflight request doesn't pass access control check: 
It does not have HTTP ok status.
```

## Root Cause
The OPTIONS preflight request handler in the `set-role` Edge Function was not explicitly returning HTTP 200 status code. While CORS headers were present, browsers require an explicit 200 status for preflight requests to succeed.

## Solution
Updated the OPTIONS handler in affected Edge Functions to explicitly return `status: 200`:

### Before:
```typescript
if (req.method === 'OPTIONS') {
  return new Response(null, { headers: corsHeaders });
}
```

### After:
```typescript
if (req.method === 'OPTIONS') {
  return new Response(null, {
    status: 200,
    headers: corsHeaders
  });
}
```

## Files Modified
1. `/supabase/functions/set-role/index.ts` - Fixed CORS preflight
2. `/supabase/functions/telegram-verify/index.ts` - Fixed CORS preflight

## Files Already Correct
The following Edge Functions already had proper status: 200 in their OPTIONS handlers:
- `bootstrap/index.ts`
- `promote-manager/index.ts`
- `seed-demo/index.ts`
- `superadmin-auth/index.ts`
- `telegram-webhook/index.ts`
- `user-mode/index.ts`

## Testing
To verify the fix:
1. Open the Telegram Web App
2. Navigate to User Management
3. Try to change a user's role
4. The CORS error should no longer appear and role changes should work

## Technical Details
- CORS preflight requests (OPTIONS) require explicit 200 status
- The preflight check happens before the actual POST/PUT request
- Without 200 status, browsers block the actual request
- This is part of the browser's security model for cross-origin requests

## Impact
Role management functionality is now fully operational. Users with appropriate permissions (owner, business_owner, manager) can now successfully change user roles without CORS errors.
