# Infrastructure RBAC & Inventory Pipeline - Implementation Complete

## Overview

The complete Infrastructure-first RBAC system with comprehensive inventory pipeline has been successfully implemented. This system provides dynamic, data-driven role-based access control with complete business isolation and audit trails.

## System Architecture

### Core Principles
- **Infrastructure-First Design**: All control originates from infrastructure ownership
- **Data-Driven RBAC**: No hardcoded permissions, all defined in database
- **Complete Business Isolation**: Row-Level Security ensures data segregation
- **Comprehensive Audit Trail**: Every action is logged immutably
- **Zero Demo Data**: All records are live and properly scoped

### Key Components

#### 1. Database Schema (11 migrations)
- **RBAC System**: Dynamic roles, permissions, and user-business mappings
- **Inventory Pipeline**: Complete chain from infrastructure → business → driver → customer
- **Audit System**: 8 specialized audit tables for different concerns
- **Helper Functions**: 6 PostgreSQL functions for complex queries

#### 2. Edge Functions (14 functions)
- `resolve-permissions`: Dynamic permission resolution with caching
- `allocate-stock`: Stock allocation request handling
- `approve-allocation`: Allocation approval workflow
- `load-driver-inventory`: Driver vehicle inventory loading
- `pin-verify`: PIN-based authentication
- `message-send`: Encrypted messaging
- `room-create`: Chat room creation
- Plus 7 additional support functions

#### 3. Frontend Components (60+ components)
- **Infrastructure Dashboards**: Owner and warehouse management
- **Business Dashboards**: Owner, manager, and analytics views
- **Driver Tools**: Order fulfillment, inventory tracking
- **RBAC UI**: Dynamic role editor, permission management
- **Context Switchers**: Multi-business role switching

#### 4. Security & Audit
- Row-Level Security on all tables
- JWT token enhancement with permissions
- Multi-layer permission caching
- Comprehensive audit logging
- Encrypted messaging system

## Usage Guide

### Creating a Business

```typescript
import { createBusiness } from '@/lib/infrastructureUtils';

const result = await createBusiness({
  name: 'My Business',
  type_id: businessTypeId,
  owner_user_id: userId,
  description: 'Business description'
});
```

### Assigning Roles

```typescript
import { assignRoleToBusiness } from '@/lib/infrastructureUtils';

const result = await assignRoleToBusiness({
  user_id: userId,
  business_id: businessId,
  role: 'manager',
  assigned_by: currentUserId,
  notes: 'Promotion to manager'
});
```

### Resolving Permissions

```typescript
import { getUserPermissions } from '@/lib/infrastructureUtils';

const { permissions } = await getUserPermissions(userId, businessId);
// permissions = ['orders.view', 'orders.create', ...]
```

### Allocating Stock

```typescript
import { allocateStockToDriver } from '@/lib/infrastructureUtils';

const result = await allocateStockToDriver({
  driver_id: driverId,
  product_id: productId,
  quantity: 100,
  requested_by: managerId,
  business_id: businessId
});
```

## Security Features

### Row-Level Security (RLS)
- Every table has RLS enabled
- Policies check business_id for isolation
- Infrastructure owners have cross-business access
- Regular users limited to their businesses

### Permission System
- Dynamic permission checking via Edge Functions
- Multi-layer caching (5 min Edge, 15 min client)
- JWT token enhancement with permission claims
- Real-time permission updates

### Audit Trail
- All actions logged immutably
- Separate logs for different concerns
- IP address and user agent tracking
- Queryable via helper functions

## Performance Optimizations

### Caching Strategy
1. **Edge Function Cache**: 5-minute TTL for permissions
2. **Database Cache**: `user_permissions_cache` table
3. **Client Cache**: 15-minute local storage

### Database Indexes
- Business_id on all relevant tables
- User_id for quick user lookups
- Composite indexes for common queries
- Timestamp indexes for audit logs

### Query Optimization
- Helper functions reduce roundtrips
- Efficient JOINs in complex queries
- Proper use of LIMIT clauses
- Selective column selection
