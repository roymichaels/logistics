# üöÄ DEPLOY NOW - Final Authentication Fix

**What we fixed**: The JWT from telegram-verify has the correct structure with custom claims, but set-role couldn't read them because it was looking in the wrong place.

---

## ‚ö° Deploy in 3 Commands

```bash
# 1. Deploy set-role (reads claims from root level now)
supabase functions deploy set-role

# 2. Deploy frontend (enhanced JWT validation logging)
# Files already built in dist/ - deploy to your hosting

# 3. Test in browser console
localStorage.clear(); sessionStorage.clear(); location.reload();
```

---

## üéØ The Fix Explained Simply

### Before:
```typescript
// set-role looked here (wrong for Telegram auth):
const role = jwt.app_metadata?.role;  // ‚ùå undefined
```

### After:
```typescript
// set-role looks at root first, then app_metadata:
const role = jwt.user_role || jwt.app_metadata?.role;  // ‚úÖ "owner"
```

### Why It Matters:
Your telegram-verify Edge Function puts custom claims at JWT root:
```json
{
  "user_id": "uuid",        // ‚Üê Root level
  "telegram_id": "12345",   // ‚Üê Root level
  "user_role": "owner",     // ‚Üê Root level
  "app_metadata": {
    "provider": "telegram"
  }
}
```

But set-role was only checking `app_metadata.role`, which doesn't exist for Telegram JWTs.

## ‚úÖ After Deployment

### Test 1: Check JWT Structure
```javascript
window.__JWT_RAW_PAYLOAD__
// Should show user_id, telegram_id, user_role at root level
```

### Test 2: Test Role Change
1. Go to User Management
2. Change a user's role
3. Should succeed (no 403 Forbidden)

### Test 3: Check Logs
```javascript
// In browser console after role change:
// Should see:
// Caller info: { role: "owner", has_custom_claims: true }
```

## üîç If It Still Doesn't Work

Run this diagnostic:

```javascript
const debug = {
  has_user_role: !!window.__JWT_RAW_PAYLOAD__?.user_role,
  has_telegram_id: !!window.__JWT_RAW_PAYLOAD__?.telegram_id,
  provider: window.__JWT_RAW_PAYLOAD__?.app_metadata?.provider,
  actual_payload: window.__JWT_RAW_PAYLOAD__
};
console.log(debug);
```

**If `has_user_role` is false**:
- Your JWT is from clientSideAuth (email provider), not telegram-verify
- Check telegram-verify Edge Function logs for errors
- Verify TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN is correct

**If `has_user_role` is true but role change fails**:
- Verify set-role Edge Function deployed successfully
- Check set-role logs for the exact error

---

## üìù Files Changed

1. **supabase/functions/set-role/index.ts** - Reads claims from root level
2. **src/lib/twaAuth.ts** - Enhanced JWT validation and logging
3. **dist/** (built) - Ready for deployment

---

## üéØ The Bottom Line

1. Your telegram-verify already creates correct JWTs ‚úÖ
2. Your frontend already uses those JWTs ‚úÖ
3. The only issue was set-role couldn't read the claims ‚úÖ ‚Üê FIXED
4. Deploy set-role and you're done ‚úÖ
