## 🔍 What Gets Validated

### JWT Token Pipeline
- ✅ Telegram WebApp initData verification
- ✅ Backend telegram-verify function
- ✅ JWT token generation with proper claims
- ✅ Session token storage in localStorage
- ✅ Token refresh mechanism
- ✅ Claims propagation to RLS policies

### Required JWT Claims
- ✅ `user_id` - Supabase auth.uid
- ✅ `telegram_id` - Telegram user identifier
- ✅ `role` - User's assigned role
- ✅ `business_id` - Business context (null for infrastructure)
- ✅ `permissions[]` - Array of permission keys
- ✅ `can_see_financials` - Financial data access flag
- ✅ `can_see_cross_business` - Cross-business access flag
- ✅ `scope_level` - Infrastructure or business scope

### RLS Policy Enforcement
- ✅ Users can read own profile
- ✅ Infrastructure roles see all businesses
- ✅ Business-scoped roles see assigned businesses only
- ✅ Drivers see only assigned orders
- ✅ Financial data respects can_see_financials
- ✅ Cross-business access enforced
- ✅ Permission cache isolated per user
- ✅ Audit logs restricted to admins

### Edge Function Security
- ✅ All functions validate JWT tokens
- ✅ CORS headers present on all responses
- ✅ RLS policies respected in database queries
- ✅ Error messages are user-friendly (Hebrew/English)
- ✅ Unauthorized requests properly rejected
- ✅ Permission caching works (5-minute TTL)

### Session Management
- ✅ Sessions persist in localStorage
- ✅ Auto-refresh enabled (tokens refresh automatically)
- ✅ Session survives page reload
- ✅ Token expiry tracked and handled
- ✅ Cross-tab session sync (via localStorage events)
- ✅ Session tracker provides real-time diagnostics

```

### SQL Validation

1. Open Supabase SQL Editor
2. Ensure you're authenticated (logged in as a user)
3. Copy/paste `supabase/scripts/validate_jwt_claims_and_rls.sql`
4. Execute and review output for ✅ PASS indicators

### Browser Inspector

1. Start dev server: `npm run dev`
2. Open app in Telegram WebApp
3. Navigate to: `http://localhost:5173/jwt-inspector.html`
4. Review real-time JWT claims and session status
5. Use "Refresh Data" button to reload latest session info

### Manual Verification

Follow the step-by-step procedures in `AUTHENTICATION_VALIDATION_GUIDE.md`:

- Section: "Manual Validation Procedures"
- 5 comprehensive manual tests
- Console commands included
- Expected output documented

---

## ✅ Success Criteria
