# Final Fixes - Session Claims & Role Updates

## Root Cause Identified

The issue was **NOT** in the RLS policies or the database - it was in the **frontend code**!

### The Problem

The `authDebug.ts` file was creating **new Supabase client instances** instead of using the singleton client that has the session. This meant:

1. ❌ When checking for session → created new client with NO session
2. ❌ Result: "not find session" error in User Management
3. ❌ When trying to update roles → used client without JWT claims
4. ❌ Result: "שגיאה בשינוי התפקיד" (role update failed)

### The Fix

Changed `authDebug.ts` to use the **shared singleton Supabase client** from `supabaseDataStore.ts`

## Files Changed

1. **src/lib/supabaseDataStore.ts** - Exported supabase client
2. **src/lib/authDebug.ts** - Use singleton client instead of creating new ones
3. **Build successful** - dist/ folder ready to deploy

## Deployment Steps

### CRITICAL: Deploy Frontend

```bash
# Deploy the dist/ folder
netlify deploy --prod --dir=dist
# or
vercel --prod
```

## Expected Results

✅ User Management loads - No "not find session" error
✅ JWT claims visible - Console shows role, workspace_id
✅ Role updates work - No "שגיאה בשינוי התפקיד" error
✅ Session persists - Across all pages

## Why This Fix Works

Before: Multiple Supabase clients, session only on ONE
After: ONE singleton client, session shared everywhere

Deploy the frontend from dist/ folder and test!
