## 2. Business Ownership System

### Ownership Structure

**Supports Multiple Owners per Business:**
- Each owner has configurable ownership percentage (0-100%)
- Total ownership per business cannot exceed 100% (database-enforced)
- Profit share percentage can differ from ownership percentage
- Voting rights configurable per owner
- Equity types: founder, investor, employee, partner

### Ownership Percentages

**Example Business:**
```
Green Leaf Premium (100% allocated)
├── Alice (Founder): 40% ownership, 40% profit share, voting rights
├── Bob (Investor): 35% ownership, 30% profit share, voting rights
├── Charlie (Employee): 20% ownership, 25% profit share, no voting
└── Diana (Partner): 5% ownership, 5% profit share, voting rights
```

**Validation:**
- Database trigger prevents total > 100%
- Transfers validated before execution
- Vesting schedules supported (immediate, cliff, linear)

### Ownership Transfers

**Multi-Party Approval Workflow:**

1. **Initiation**: Owner proposes transfer
2. **Approval Required From:**
   - From user (transferring ownership)
   - To user (receiving ownership)
   - Platform owner (for oversight)
3. **Execution**: Automatic when all approvals in place
4. **Audit**: Complete transfer history maintained

**Transfer Types:**
- Sale (with amount tracking)
- Gift
- Inheritance
- Vesting (automatic based on schedule)
- Forfeiture

### Vesting Schedules

**Configuration:**
```json
{
  "type": "linear",
  "total_months": 48,
  "cliff_months": 12
}
```

**Calculation:**
- Before cliff: 0% vested
- After cliff: Linear vesting over remaining period
- Automatic calculation via `calculate_vested_percentage()`

### Business Decisions & Voting

**Major Decisions Require Owner Votes:**

**Decision Types:**
- Operational (>50% approval threshold)
- Structural (>66% approval threshold)
- Financial (>50% approval threshold)
- Strategic (>66% approval threshold)

**Voting:**
- Weighted by ownership percentage
- Only owners with voting rights participate
- Deadline-based voting periods
- Automatic resolution when threshold met

### Financial Distributions

**Profit Distribution Calculation:**

```typescript
// Monthly/Quarterly
const businessRevenue = 150000;
const businessCosts = 90000;
const netProfit = 60000;

// Owner with 40% profit share
const ownerDistribution = netProfit * 0.40; // ₪24,000

// View pending distributions
SELECT * FROM v_pending_distributions WHERE business_id = 'biz-id';
```

**Distribution Status:**
- Calculated → Approved → Paid → (Failed)
- Payment methods: bank transfer, check, cash, crypto
- Complete audit trail

---

## 3. Manager Orders Page Enhancement

- Date range: today, week, month, all
- Zone filter
- Driver filter
- Priority: urgent, high, medium, low
- Search: name, phone, address, order ID

**Bulk Operations:**
- Multi-select with checkboxes
- Select all filtered orders
- Bulk driver assignment
- Clear selection

**Export:**
- CSV export with all order data
- Timestamped filenames
- Excel-compatible formatting

**Order Cards:**
- Customer info (name, phone, address)
- Status badges (color-coded)
- Priority indicators
- Total amount display
- Assigned driver info
- Created timestamp

---

## 4. Update User Role System

### Role Change Workflow

**Authorization Rules:**

**Infrastructure Owner:**
- Can change any role to any role
- No restrictions

**Business Manager:**
- Can change: sales → driver, warehouse, customer_service
- Can change: driver → sales, warehouse, customer_service
- Can change: warehouse → driver, sales, customer_service
- Cannot change: anyone → owner
- Cannot change: owner → anything
- Cannot change: own role

**Business Owner (Non-Platform):**
- Same as Business Manager
- Plus: Can add co-owners with ownership percentage
- Requires platform owner approval for owner role changes

### Validation Rules

**Required:**
1. Actor has permission to change role
2. Target user exists
3. New role is different from current role
4. Reason provided (minimum 10 characters recommended)
5. Not changing own role

**Blocked Scenarios:**
- Self role changes (prevents lockout)
- Demoting infrastructure owner
- Non-owner promoting to owner (requires platform owner)

### Permission Differences Display

**Shows User Impact:**

**Adding Permissions (Green):**
```
✅ New Permissions (5):
• Create orders
• Assign orders to drivers
• View all business orders
• Approve restock requests
• Manage team members
```

**Removing Permissions (Red):**
```
❌ Removed Permissions (2):
• View all businesses
• System configuration access
```

**Confirmation Required:**
- Shows before/after role comparison
- Displays reason for change
- Requires explicit confirmation

### Audit Trail

**Logged Information:**
- Actor (who changed role)
- Target (whose role changed)
- Old role
- New role
- Reason provided
- Timestamp
- IP address (if available)
- User agent (if available)

**Audit Log Query:**
```sql
SELECT * FROM user_audit_log
WHERE target_user_id = 'telegram_id'
ORDER BY created_at DESC;
```

---

## 5. Multi-Tenant Data Isolation

### Row Level Security (RLS)

**Enforcement Level:** PostgreSQL Database

**Orders Table:**
```sql
-- Sales: Own orders only
WHERE created_by = current_user_telegram_id

-- Driver: Assigned orders only
WHERE assigned_driver = current_user_telegram_id

-- Warehouse: NO ACCESS
WHERE false

-- Manager: Business orders
WHERE business_id IN (SELECT business_id FROM business_users WHERE user_id = current_user)

-- Owner: All orders across all businesses
-- No RLS filter applied
```

**Inventory Table:**
```sql
-- Sales: Read-only
SELECT only, no INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE

-- Warehouse: Full access
All operations allowed

-- Driver: Own inventory only
WHERE driver_id = current_user_telegram_id

-- Manager: Business inventory
WHERE business_id = user_business_id
```

**Business Ownership Table:**
```sql
-- Owners: Own business ownership structure
WHERE business_id IN (
  SELECT business_id FROM business_ownership WHERE owner_user_id = current_user
)

-- Platform Owner: All ownership structures
-- No filter applied
```

### Business Context

**User → Business Association:**

```typescript
// User can belong to multiple businesses
business_users table:
- user_id: alice-uuid
- business_id: green-leaf-uuid
- role: manager
- is_primary: true

- user_id: alice-uuid
- business_id: fast-herbs-uuid
- role: driver
- is_primary: false
```

**Primary Business:**
- Default context for UI
- Used for dashboard routing
- Can switch between assigned businesses

**Inherited Permissions:**
- Infrastructure roles have access to all businesses
- Business roles scoped to assigned businesses only
- Permissions are additive (cannot restrict below role defaults)

---

## 6. Data Access Scopes

### Scope Definitions

**`all` - Infrastructure Owner:**
- View all businesses
- View all orders across all businesses
- View all users across all businesses
- View all inventory across all businesses
- Complete financial visibility

**`business` - Manager, Dispatcher, Warehouse, Customer Service:**
- View own business data only
- View business orders
- View business inventory
- View business team members
- Business-scoped financial data

**`own` - Sales, Basic User:**
- View only own created records
- View own profile
- View own commission/earnings
- No access to other users' data

**`assigned` - Driver:**
- View only assigned orders
- View own inventory
- View own earnings
- View assigned zones

### Implementation

```typescript
import { getDataAccessScope } from '../lib/rolePermissions';

const scope = getDataAccessScope(user.role);

// Use scope to determine query filters
switch (scope) {
  case 'all':
    // No business_id filter
    query = query.select('*');
    break;

  case 'business':
    // Filter by user's business(es)
    query = query
      .select('*')
      .in('business_id', userBusinessIds);
    break;

  case 'own':
    // Filter by created_by or user_id
    query = query
      .select('*')
      .eq('created_by', user.telegram_id);
    break;

  case 'assigned':
    // Filter by assignment
    query = query
      .select('*')
      .eq('assigned_driver', user.telegram_id);
    break;
}
```

## 8. Edge Cases & Conflict Resolution

### Edge Case 1: User Belongs to Multiple Businesses

**Scenario:**
Driver works for both Green Leaf Premium and Fast Herbs.

**Solution:**
```typescript
// User has two business_users entries
business_users:
  - business_id: green-leaf, role: driver
  - business_id: fast-herbs, role: driver

// Orders query returns orders from both businesses
// Each order tagged with business_id for context
// Driver's inventory tracked separately per business

// UI shows business tags:
Order #GL-000123 (Green Leaf Premium)
Order #FH-000456 (Fast Herbs)
```

**Primary Business:**
- User.primary_business_id determines default context
- Can switch businesses in UI

### Edge Case 2: Owner Leaving Business

**Scenario:**
Owner wants to leave but has 40% ownership.

**Workflow:**
1. Owner must transfer all ownership first
2. Cannot delete owner record while ownership > 0%
3. Transfer ownership to remaining owners or new investors
4. After 0% ownership, role can be changed
5. Complete audit trail maintained

**Database Constraint:**
```sql
-- Prevent owner deletion with active ownership
CHECK: ownership_percentage = 0 before allowing role change from owner
```

### Edge Case 3: Multiple Owners Approving Same Action

**Scenario:**
Two owners simultaneously try to approve conflicting actions.

**Solution:**
1. Database-level locking on critical operations
2. First approval wins principle
3. Automatic notification to second approver
4. Option to propose alternative decision
5. Voting system prevents simultaneous conflicts

**Implementation:**
```sql
-- Transaction-level locking
BEGIN;
SELECT * FROM business_decisions WHERE id = 'decision-id' FOR UPDATE;
UPDATE business_decisions SET votes = votes || new_vote;
COMMIT;
```

### Edge Case 4: Ownership Percentage Conflicts

**Scenario:**
Two users try to add ownership simultaneously, total would exceed 100%.

**Solution:**
```sql
-- Trigger validates BEFORE insert/update
CREATE TRIGGER validate_ownership_percentage_trigger
  BEFORE INSERT OR UPDATE ON business_ownership
  FOR EACH ROW
  EXECUTE FUNCTION validate_ownership_percentage();

-- Transaction ensures atomicity
-- One insert succeeds, other fails with clear error
-- Error: "Total ownership for business would exceed 100%"
```

### Edge Case 5: Driver Shared Across Businesses with Different Inventories

**Scenario:**
Driver has 10 units of Product A in Green Leaf inventory, 5 units in Fast Herbs inventory.

**Solution:**
```typescript
// Inventory tracked per business
driver_inventory:
  - driver_id: driver-123
  - business_id: green-leaf-id
  - product_id: product-a
  - quantity: 10

  - driver_id: driver-123
  - business_id: fast-herbs-id
  - product_id: product-a
  - quantity: 5

// Order assignment checks correct business inventory
// Cannot fulfill Green Leaf order using Fast Herbs inventory
```

---

## 9. Security Best Practices

### 1. Never Trust Client Input

**Always validate on server:**
```typescript
// BAD: Trusting client role
if (user.clientProvidedRole === 'owner') { }

// GOOD: Server-side validation
const dbUser = await dataStore.getProfile();
if (hasPermission(dbUser, 'users:delete')) { }
```

### 2. Use RLS for All Tables

**Every table with sensitive data:**
```sql
ALTER TABLE sensitive_table ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;

CREATE POLICY "Users can access own data"
  ON sensitive_table FOR SELECT
  TO authenticated
  USING (user_id = auth.uid());
```

### 3. Audit Sensitive Actions

**Log before and after state:**
```typescript
await dataStore.supabase.rpc('log_role_change', {
  target_user_id,
  old_role,
  new_role,
  performed_by,
  reason
});
```

### 4. Require Reason for Critical Changes

**Role changes, ownership transfers:**
```typescript
if (!reason || reason.trim().length < 10) {
  throw new Error('Reason required for role change');
}
```

### 5. Multi-Party Approval for High-Risk Actions

**Ownership transfers, owner promotions:**
```typescript
const transfer = await getTransfer(transferId);

if (!(
  transfer.approved_by_from &&
  transfer.approved_by_to &&
  transfer.approved_by_platform
)) {
  throw new Error('Transfer requires all approvals');
}
```

### 6. Rate Limiting

**Prevent abuse:**
```typescript
// Implement at API gateway level
// Per user: 100 requests/minute
// Per business: 1000 requests/minute
// Platform: 10000 requests/minute
```

### 7. Session Management

**Invalidate sessions on role change:**
```typescript
await dataStore.supabase.auth.admin.signOut(userId);
// Force re-authentication with new permissions
```

---

## 10. Performance Optimization

### Database Indexes

**Created by Migration:**
```sql
-- Business ownership
CREATE INDEX idx_business_ownership_business ON business_ownership(business_id) WHERE active = true;
CREATE INDEX idx_business_ownership_owner ON business_ownership(owner_user_id) WHERE active = true;

-- Ownership transfers
CREATE INDEX idx_ownership_transfers_business ON ownership_transfers(business_id);
CREATE INDEX idx_ownership_transfers_status ON ownership_transfers(status);

-- Business decisions
CREATE INDEX idx_business_decisions_business ON business_decisions(business_id);
CREATE INDEX idx_business_decisions_status ON business_decisions(status);

-- Financial distributions
CREATE INDEX idx_financial_distributions_business ON financial_distributions(business_id);
CREATE INDEX idx_financial_distributions_owner ON financial_distributions(owner_user_id);
CREATE INDEX idx_financial_distributions_period ON financial_distributions(period_start_date, period_end_date);
```

### Caching Strategy

**Redis/Memory Cache:**
```typescript
// User permissions (5 minute TTL)
const cacheKey = `permissions:${user.telegram_id}`;
const cached = await redis.get(cacheKey);
if (cached) return JSON.parse(cached);

const permissions = getUserPermissions(user);
await redis.setex(cacheKey, 300, JSON.stringify(permissions));
```

**Business Settings (10 minute TTL):**
```typescript
const cacheKey = `business:${businessId}:settings`;
// Invalidate on business.update
```

**Product Catalog (30 minute TTL):**
```typescript
const cacheKey = `products:${businessId}`;
// Invalidate on product.update
```

### Query Optimization

**Use materialized views for complex aggregations:**
```sql
-- Created by migration
CREATE OR REPLACE VIEW v_business_ownership_summary AS ...
CREATE OR REPLACE VIEW v_pending_distributions AS ...

-- Refresh when needed
REFRESH MATERIALIZED VIEW v_business_ownership_summary;
```

**Pagination for large result sets:**
```typescript
const { data, count } = await dataStore.supabase
  .from('orders')
  .select('*', { count: 'exact' })
  .range(offset, offset + limit - 1);
```

```

**Check ownership totals per business:**
```sql
SELECT * FROM v_business_ownership_summary
WHERE total_allocated_ownership != 100;
```

**Recent role changes:**
```sql
SELECT * FROM user_audit_log
WHERE action = 'role_change'
AND created_at >= NOW() - INTERVAL '7 days'
ORDER BY created_at DESC;
```

**Permission check failures:**
```sql
-- Implement logging for failed permission checks
SELECT * FROM permission_check_log
WHERE result = 'denied'
AND created_at >= NOW() - INTERVAL '24 hours';
```

---

## 13. Quick Start Guide

### For Developers

**1. Check User Permissions:**
```typescript
import { hasPermission } from './src/lib/rolePermissions';

if (hasPermission(user, 'orders:create')) {
  // Show create order button
}
```

**2. Get Role Info:**
```typescript
import { getRoleInfo } from './src/lib/rolePermissions';

const roleInfo = getRoleInfo(user.role);
console.log(roleInfo.description);
console.log(`Permissions: ${roleInfo.permissions.length}`);
```

**3. Check Role Change Authorization:**
```typescript
import { canChangeUserRole } from './src/lib/rolePermissions';

const authCheck = canChangeUserRole(currentUser, targetRole, newRole);
if (!authCheck.allowed) {
  alert(authCheck.reason);
}
```

**4. Query with RLS:**
```typescript
// RLS automatically applied
const { data } = await supabase
  .from('orders')
  .select('*');
// Returns only orders user can access
```

**5. Create Ownership:**
```typescript
const { data, error } = await supabase
  .from('business_ownership')
  .insert({
    business_id: 'uuid',
    owner_user_id: 'uuid',
    ownership_percentage: 40,
    profit_share_percentage: 40,
    equity_type: 'founder'
  });
```
