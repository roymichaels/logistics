# Complete Orders Management System - Implementation Guide

## Overview

A comprehensive orders management system with real-time driver assignment, order tracking, and analytics. Built with React, TypeScript, Supabase, and the Royal theme aesthetic.

## Features Implemented

### 1. Database Schema

- Order status management
- Automatic GPS location updates
- Push notifications for new assignments
- Assignment modal integration
- Haptic feedback

### 6. Order Analytics (`src/components/OrderAnalytics.tsx`)
Comprehensive analytics dashboard:
- Time range filtering (today, week, month, all)
- Key metrics (total orders, completion rate, revenue)
- Orders by status breakdown
- Top performing drivers leaderboard
- Orders per hour chart
- Average delivery time
- Cancellation rate tracking
- Revenue trends

### 7. Enhanced Order Types
Extended Order interface with:
- Full delivery lifecycle timestamps
- Priority levels (low, medium, high, urgent)
- Customer ratings and feedback
- Delivery proof URLs
- Estimated vs actual delivery times

## Database Migrations

The system uses a single comprehensive migration: `enhance_orders_driver_system.sql`

Key features:
- Automatic driver profile creation on role change
- Automatic status history logging
- Automatic driver stats updates on delivery
- Comprehensive RLS policies for security
- Performance indexes on all key fields

## Security & Permissions

### RLS Policies
- Drivers can only view/update their own data
- Managers and dispatchers have full access
- Order assignments restricted by role
- Location data protected per driver
- Notification access controlled

### Role-Based Access
- **Owner/Manager**: Full system access
- **Dispatcher**: Order assignment and monitoring
- **Driver**: Own deliveries and assignments
- **Sales**: Order creation only
- **Warehouse**: No order access

## API Usage Examples

### Driver Service

```typescript
const driverService = new DriverService(dataStore);

// Get available drivers near location
const drivers = await driverService.getAvailableDrivers({
  latitude: 32.0853,
  longitude: 34.7818,
  maxDistance: 10 // km
});

// Update driver location
await driverService.updateDriverLocation(
  driverId,
  latitude,
  longitude,
  { accuracy: 10, heading: 180, speed: 40 }
);

// Create order assignment
const assignment = await driverService.createOrderAssignment({
  orderId: order.id,
  driverId: driver.user_id,
  assignedBy: currentUser.telegram_id,
  timeoutMinutes: 5
});

// Driver responds to assignment
await driverService.respondToAssignment(
  assignmentId,
  'accepted'
);

// Get driver stats
const stats = await driverService.getDriverStats(driverId);
```

### Real-time Order Tracking

```typescript
// Subscribe to order updates
const subscription = supabase
  .channel(`order-${orderId}`)
  .on('postgres_changes', {
    event: '*',
    schema: 'public',
    table: 'orders',
    filter: `id=eq.${orderId}`
  }, (payload) => {
    // Handle order update
    loadOrderData();
  })
  .subscribe();
```

### Order Analytics

```typescript
// Load analytics for specific time range
<OrderAnalytics
  supabase={supabase}
  userRole={user.role}
  timeRange="week"
/>
```

## Component Integration

### Using Driver Assignment Modal

```typescript
import { DriverAssignmentModal } from '../src/components/DriverAssignmentModal';

const [pendingAssignment, setPendingAssignment] = useState(null);

// Show modal when assignment is created
{pendingAssignment && (
  <DriverAssignmentModal
    assignment={pendingAssignment}
    onAccept={handleAcceptAssignment}
    onDecline={handleDeclineAssignment}
    onClose={() => setPendingAssignment(null)}
    theme={theme}
  />
)}
```

### Using Order Tracking

```typescript
import { OrderTracking } from '../src/components/OrderTracking';

<OrderTracking
  orderId={orderId}
  supabase={supabase}
  onClose={() => navigate('orders')}
/>
```

## Real-time Features

### Order Status Updates

## Performance Optimizations

### Database Indexes
```sql
- idx_driver_profiles_is_available
- idx_order_assignments_response_status
- idx_driver_locations_recorded_at
- idx_orders_status
- idx_orders_assigned_driver
- idx_orders_priority
```

### Query Optimizations
- Efficient joins with driver profiles
- Limited result sets for location history
- Aggregated statistics queries
- Cached analytics data

## Styling & Theme

All components use the Royal theme:
- Dark purple gradient backgrounds
- Consistent card styling
- Status-based color coding
- Smooth animations and transitions
- Responsive design for mobile/desktop
- Accessibility considerations
