## üîê Security Implementation

### Row Level Security (RLS)

**All tables have RLS enabled with restrictive policies:**

**business_ownership:**
- Owners can view ownership of their businesses
- Platform owner can view all
- Only platform owner can create ownership records
- Prevents unauthorized ownership visibility

**ownership_transfers:**
- Parties involved can view their transfers
- Business owners can view all transfers for their business
- Owners can propose transfers
- Multi-party approval required

**business_decisions:**
- Business owners can view and create decisions
- Voting restricted to owners with voting rights
- Decision execution requires approval threshold

**financial_distributions:**
- Owners can view only their own distributions
- Platform owner can view all
- Only platform owner can create distributions

**Existing Tables Enhanced:**
- Orders: Role-based filtering (sales/driver/warehouse rules)
- Inventory: Read/write split by role
- Users: Profile access restrictions
- Products: Role-based CRUD permissions

### Authorization Layers

**1. Database Level (RLS):**
- Automatic filtering in all queries
- Cannot be bypassed via API
- PostgreSQL enforces at query execution

**2. Application Level (Permission Checks):**
- `hasPermission()` checks before actions
- UI elements hidden if no permission
- API endpoints validate before processing

**3. Component Level:**
- Role-based component rendering
- Conditional feature availability
- Permission-aware UI elements

**4. Audit Level:**
- All sensitive actions logged
- Actor, target, action, timestamp captured
- Immutable audit trail

## üöÄ Usage Examples

### 1. Check User Permissions

```typescript
import { hasPermission, hasAnyPermission } from '../lib/rolePermissions';

// Check single permission
if (hasPermission(user, 'orders:assign_driver')) {
  // Show driver assignment button
}

// Check multiple permissions
if (hasAnyPermission(user, ['orders:create', 'orders:update'])) {
  // Allow order management
}

// Get all permissions for display
const permissions = getUserPermissions(user);
console.log(`User has ${permissions.length} permissions`);
```

### 2. Role Change Authorization

```typescript
import { canChangeUserRole } from '../lib/rolePermissions';

const authCheck = canChangeUserRole(
  currentUser,        // Actor (who is changing)
  targetUser.role,    // Current role
  'manager'           // Desired role
);

if (authCheck.allowed) {
  // Proceed with role change
} else {
  showError(authCheck.reason); // "Only platform owner can assign owner role"
}
```

### 3. Data Access Scope

```typescript
import { getDataAccessScope } from '../lib/rolePermissions';

const scope = getDataAccessScope(user.role);

switch (scope) {
  case 'all':
    // Infrastructure owner - load all businesses
    break;
  case 'business':
    // Manager - load own business data
    break;
  case 'own':
    // Sales - load only own records
    break;
  case 'assigned':
    // Driver - load only assigned orders
    break;
}
```

### 4. Ownership Management

```typescript
// Check ownership percentage
const { data: ownership } = await supabase
  .from('business_ownership')
  .select('*')
  .eq('business_id', businessId);

const totalOwnership = ownership.reduce((sum, o) => sum + o.ownership_percentage, 0);
const availableOwnership = 100 - totalOwnership;

// Calculate vested percentage
const vestedPct = await supabase.rpc('calculate_vested_percentage', {
  p_ownership_id: ownershipId
});

// Process ownership transfer (requires all approvals)
const result = await supabase.rpc('process_ownership_transfer', {
  p_transfer_id: transferId
});
```

### 5. Financial Distributions

```typescript
// View pending distributions
const { data: distributions } = await supabase
  .from('v_pending_distributions')
  .select('*')
  .eq('business_id', businessId);

distributions.forEach(dist => {
  console.log(`${dist.owner_name}: ‚Ç™${dist.owner_share} (${dist.profit_share_percentage}%)`);
});

// Create distribution record
const { data } = await supabase
  .from('financial_distributions')
  .insert({
    business_id: businessId,
    owner_user_id: ownerId,
    distribution_period: 'Q1 2025',
    period_start_date: '2025-01-01',
    period_end_date: '2025-03-31',
    total_business_revenue: 150000,
    total_business_costs: 90000,
    net_profit: 60000,
    ownership_percentage: 40,
    profit_share_percentage: 40,
    distribution_amount: 24000, // 60000 * 0.40
    status: 'calculated'
  });
```

## üß™ Testing Scenarios

### Test 1: Role-Based Order Visibility

**As Sales Rep:**
```typescript
// Should only see orders they created
const orders = await dataStore.listOrders();
// RLS automatically filters: WHERE created_by = sales_user_id
```

**As Driver:**
```typescript
// Should only see orders assigned to them
const orders = await dataStore.listOrders();
// RLS automatically filters: WHERE assigned_driver = driver_telegram_id
```

**As Warehouse:**
```typescript
// Should see NO orders (business rule)
const orders = await dataStore.listOrders();
// Returns empty array
```

**As Manager:**
```typescript
// Should see all business orders
const orders = await dataStore.listOrders();
// RLS filters: WHERE business_id IN (user's businesses)
```

**As Infrastructure Owner:**
```typescript
// Should see ALL orders across ALL businesses
const orders = await dataStore.listOrders();
// No RLS filtering applied
```

### Test 2: Ownership Percentage Validation

**Test Case: Prevent exceeding 100%**
```sql
-- Current ownership: 60% allocated
INSERT INTO business_ownership (business_id, owner_user_id, ownership_percentage)
VALUES ('business-uuid', 'user-uuid', 50); -- Would total 110%

-- Expected: ERROR - Total ownership for business would exceed 100%
```

**Test Case: Transfer with approval**
```sql
-- Create transfer
INSERT INTO ownership_transfers (business_id, from_user_id, to_user_id, percentage_transferred)
VALUES ('biz-id', 'alice-id', 'bob-id', 10);

-- Approve by Alice
UPDATE ownership_transfers SET approved_by_from = true WHERE id = 'transfer-id';

-- Approve by Bob
UPDATE ownership_transfers SET approved_by_to = true WHERE id = 'transfer-id';

-- Approve by Platform Owner
UPDATE ownership_transfers SET approved_by_platform = true WHERE id = 'transfer-id';

-- Process transfer
SELECT process_ownership_transfer('transfer-id');

-- Verify: Alice now has 10% less, Bob has 10% more
```

### Test 3: Role Change Authorization

**Test Case: Manager changing sales role**
```typescript
const result = canChangeUserRole(
  { role: 'manager' },  // Actor
  'sales',              // Target current
  'driver'              // Target new
);
// Expected: { allowed: true }
```

**Test Case: Manager attempting owner promotion**
```typescript
const result = canChangeUserRole(
  { role: 'manager' },  // Actor
  'manager',            // Target current
  'owner'               // Target new
);
// Expected: { allowed: false, reason: 'Only platform owner can assign owner role' }
```

**Test Case: Self role change blocked**
```typescript
const result = canChangeUserRole(
  { role: 'manager', telegram_id: '123' },
  'manager', // Same role
  'owner'
);
// Expected: { allowed: false, reason: 'Cannot change your own role' }
```

VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_anon_key
```

### Database Functions

- Business data isolation
- Ownership visibility restrictions
- Transfer approval requirements
- Financial data access control

---

## üìû Support & Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Issue: "Total ownership would exceed 100%"**
- **Cause:** Attempting to add ownership that would total >100%
- **Solution:** Check current total, reduce amount, or remove inactive owners

**Issue: "Cannot change own role"**
- **Cause:** User attempting to change their own role
- **Solution:** Have another authorized user change the role

**Issue: "Only platform owner can assign owner role"**
- **Cause:** Non-platform-owner attempting owner promotion
- **Solution:** Platform owner must perform owner promotions

**Issue: Transfer stuck in pending**
- **Cause:** Missing one or more required approvals
- **Solution:** Check approved_by_from, approved_by_to, approved_by_platform fields

### Debug Queries

**Check ownership totals:**
```sql
SELECT * FROM v_business_ownership_summary WHERE business_id = 'your-biz-id';
```

**Find pending transfers:**
```sql
SELECT * FROM ownership_transfers WHERE status = 'pending' AND business_id = 'your-biz-id';
```

**View user audit trail:**
```sql
SELECT * FROM user_audit_log WHERE target_user_id = 'user-telegram-id' ORDER BY created_at DESC LIMIT 20;
```

**Check pending distributions:**
```sql
SELECT * FROM v_pending_distributions WHERE business_id = 'your-biz-id';
```
