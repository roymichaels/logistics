## Part 2: Infrastructure Creation Bug Fix

### Problem
Users were encountering a 403 Forbidden error when creating businesses:
```
Failed to create infrastructure: new row violates row-level security policy for table "infrastructures"
```

### Root Cause
The RLS policies on the `infrastructures` table were too restrictive:
- Only `service_role` or `superadmin` could create infrastructures
- No explicit INSERT policy for authenticated users
- Conflicting policies from multiple migrations

### Solution Implemented
Created migration `/supabase/migrations/20251102000000_fix_infrastructure_insert_policy.sql`:

1. **Drops conflicting policies** (7 old policies)
2. **Creates granular policies**:
   - `infrastructures_authenticated_insert` - Allows authenticated users to INSERT
   - `infrastructures_member_select` - Users view only their infrastructures
   - `infrastructures_owner_update` - Owners can UPDATE their infrastructures
   - `infrastructures_superadmin_delete` - Only superadmins can DELETE
   - `infrastructures_service_role_all` - Service role full access

### How to Apply the Fix

#### Option 1: Via Supabase SQL Editor (Quickest)
1. Open Supabase Dashboard → SQL Editor
2. Copy SQL from `supabase/migrations/20251102000000_fix_infrastructure_insert_policy.sql`
3. Click "Run"

#### Option 2: Via Supabase CLI
```bash
supabase db push
```

#### Option 3: Direct SQL (see FIX_INFRASTRUCTURE_CREATION.md)

### Security Improvements
- Authenticated users can create infrastructures (needed for onboarding)
- Users only see infrastructures they have access to
- Proper access control for updates and deletes
- Service role maintains system-level access

### Files Created
1. `/supabase/migrations/20251102000000_fix_infrastructure_insert_policy.sql` - Database migration
2. `/FIX_INFRASTRUCTURE_CREATION.md` - Detailed fix documentation
3. `/apply_infrastructure_fix.sh` - Automated application script
