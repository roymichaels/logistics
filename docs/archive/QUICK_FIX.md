# Quick Fix for Netlify Deployment

## What Changed

Updated `vite.config.ts` to:
1. Check `process.env` FIRST (Netlify injects variables here)
2. Added detailed logging to debug environment variable availability
3. Prioritized non-VITE_ prefixed variables for production builds

## Deploy Now

### Step 1: Push Changes
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Fix: Priority process.env for Netlify environment variables"
git push
```

### Step 2: Netlify Will Auto-Deploy
Or manually trigger in dashboard:
- Deploys > Trigger deploy > Clear cache and deploy site

### Step 3: Check Build Logs
Look for this output in Netlify build logs:

**Success:**
```
üîç Environment variable check:
   Mode: production
   process.env.SUPABASE_URL: ‚úÖ Found
   process.env.VITE_SUPABASE_URL: ‚ùå Not found
   Final supabaseUrl: ‚úÖ https://ncuyyjvvzea...
   Final supabaseAnonKey: ‚úÖ eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1...

‚úÖ Environment variables loaded successfully
```

**If it fails:**
The logs will show exactly which variables are missing and what's available in `process.env`.

## Why This Works

**Netlify's Environment:**
- Variables configured in Site Settings > Environment Variables
- Injected directly into `process.env` during build
- NOT loaded through `.env` files
- Vite's `loadEnv()` doesn't pick them up automatically

**The Fix:**
```javascript
// OLD (didn't work in Netlify)
const supabaseUrl = env.VITE_SUPABASE_URL || process.env.VITE_SUPABASE_URL || '';

// NEW (works everywhere)
const supabaseUrl =
  process.env.SUPABASE_URL ||           // ‚Üê Netlify injects here
  process.env.VITE_SUPABASE_URL ||
  env.SUPABASE_URL ||
  env.VITE_SUPABASE_URL ||
  '';
```

## Troubleshooting

### Build Still Fails

1. **Check Netlify Environment Variables**
   - Go to: Site Settings > Environment variables
   - Verify `SUPABASE_URL` exists and has value
   - Verify `SUPABASE_ANON_KEY` exists and has value

2. **Check Build Logs**
   - Look for the "üîç Environment variable check:" section
   - It will show exactly what was found
   - The debug output will list all SUPABASE-related keys in process.env

3. **Variable Names Must Be Exact**
   - `SUPABASE_URL` (not Supabase_URL or supabase_url)
   - `SUPABASE_ANON_KEY` (not SUPABASE_ANON_KEY_ or similar)

### Build Succeeds But App Doesn't Work

This shouldn't happen if build succeeds with the new validation, but if it does:
1. Hard refresh browser (Ctrl+Shift+R)
2. Check browser console for specific errors
3. Run `window.runAuthDiagnostics()` in console

## What The Logs Tell You

### Locally (Development)
```
process.env.SUPABASE_URL: ‚ùå Not found
process.env.VITE_SUPABASE_URL: ‚ùå Not found
Final supabaseUrl: ‚úÖ https://ncuyyjvvzea...
```
This is correct - local uses .env file loaded by Vite.

### Netlify (Production)
```
process.env.SUPABASE_URL: ‚úÖ Found
process.env.VITE_SUPABASE_URL: ‚ùå Not found
Final supabaseUrl: ‚úÖ https://ncuyyjvvzea...
```
This is what we expect - Netlify uses direct process.env injection.

## Summary

‚úÖ Build system now checks `process.env.SUPABASE_URL` first
‚úÖ Detailed logging helps debug environment variable issues
‚úÖ Works with your existing Netlify environment variables
‚úÖ No need to rename or duplicate variables
‚úÖ Just push and deploy!

The enhanced logging will show exactly what's happening during the Netlify build, making it easy to diagnose any remaining issues.
