# Archived Documentation

This directory contains old authentication fix documentation that has been superseded.

## Why These Were Archived

Multiple iterations of authentication fixes were created during debugging sessions, resulting in duplicate and outdated documentation. These files have been archived to clean up the project root.

## Current Documentation

- `docs/telegram-authentication.md` - Current authentication guide
- `docs/deployment-runbook.md` - Deployment procedures
- `README.md` - Project overview

- Multiple AUTHENTICATION_*.md variations
- Multiple DEPLOYMENT_*.md variations
- Multiple QUICK_FIX_*.md variations
- Multiple START_HERE_*.md variations
- Old .txt guides

## Note

If you need to reference these for historical context, they remain available in this archive directory. However, the current documentation in the main `docs/` directory is the authoritative source.
