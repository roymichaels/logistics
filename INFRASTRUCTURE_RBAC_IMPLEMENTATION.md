## What Was Implemented

### 1. Database Schema (8 Migrations Applied)

#### Dynamic RBAC System
- **`permissions`** - 70+ atomic permissions organized by module (orders, inventory, financial, etc.)
- **`roles`** - Base role definitions with infrastructure vs business scope distinction
- **`role_permissions`** - Many-to-many junction for flexible permission assignment
- **`custom_roles`** - Business-specific role customizations
- **`custom_role_permissions`** - Permissions for customized roles
- **`user_business_roles`** - Multi-business role assignments with ownership tracking
- **`role_change_log`** - Complete audit trail of all role modifications
- **`user_permissions_cache`** - Performance optimization with 5-minute TTL

#### Infrastructure Warehouse System
- **`warehouses`** - Physical/virtual storage with scope_level (infrastructure vs business)
- **`inventory_movements`** - Immutable audit trail of all transfers (infra → business → driver → customer)
- **`stock_allocations`** - Infrastructure-to-business allocation workflow with approval
- **`driver_vehicle_inventory`** - Mobile inventory with zone and vehicle context
- **`inventory_reconciliation` + `reconciliation_items`** - Physical count vs system verification
- **`warehouse_capacity_limits`** - Capacity management and over-allocation prevention

#### Comprehensive Audit System
- **`system_audit_log`** - Master audit log for all system events
- **`financial_audit_log`** - Specialized tracking for all financial operations
- **`cross_scope_access_log`** - Support override tracking for infrastructure managers
- **`data_export_log`** - GDPR compliance and export tracking
- **`login_history`** - Authentication events with device fingerprinting
- **`permission_check_failures`** - Security monitoring for denied access attempts
- **`equity_transfer_log`** - Ownership change complete history
- **`business_lifecycle_log`** - Business creation and modification tracking

### 2. Row-Level Security (RLS)

✅ **Infrastructure Scope Policies**
- Infrastructure roles get global read/write across all businesses
- Infrastructure_owner has unrestricted access to all data
- Infrastructure_warehouse controls all warehouses and allocations

✅ **Business Scope Policies**
- Business owners access only their business data with complete financial visibility
- Business roles scoped by `business_id` matching JWT claim
- Custom roles cannot grant permissions beyond base role scope

✅ **Audit Policies**
- All audit tables are append-only (no updates/deletes)
- Read access restricted to infrastructure_owner and relevant business owners
- System can insert but users cannot modify audit records

### 3. Backend Services (4 Edge Functions Deployed)

#### `resolve-permissions`
- Merges base role + custom role permissions
- Returns resolved permissions array for JWT injection
- Caches results in database and in-memory (5-minute TTL)
- Handles both infrastructure and business contexts

#### `allocate-stock`
- Creates stock allocation requests from infrastructure to business warehouses
- Validates scope levels (source must be infrastructure, destination must be business)
- Checks inventory availability before creating request
- Logs all requests in audit trail

#### `approve-allocation`
- Infrastructure warehouse workers approve/reject allocation requests
- Validates approved quantity doesn't exceed availability
- Auto-fulfill option transfers inventory immediately
- Creates inventory movements and updates stock levels

#### `load-driver-inventory`
- Transfers inventory from warehouse to driver vehicle
- Validates warehouse availability and driver status
- Updates driver_vehicle_inventory with zone context
- Logs movements and driver actions

### 4. Frontend Components (5 New Components)

#### `dynamicPermissions.ts`
- Replaces hardcoded rolePermissions.ts
- Functions: `hasPermission`, `hasAnyPermission`, `hasAllPermissions`
- Async permission checking with caching
- Synchronous checks for UI rendering

#### `BusinessContextSwitcher.tsx`
- Multi-business user support with dropdown selector
- Displays ownership percentage and primary business indicators
- Invalidates permission cache on context switch
- Visual feedback for current business

#### `DynamicRoleEditor.tsx`
- Infrastructure owners edit base roles and all permissions
- Business owners customize business-level roles
- Permission grouping by module with toggle interface
- Version history and rollback capability (database support)
- Cannot grant infrastructure-only permissions to business roles

#### `InfrastructureOwnerDashboard.tsx`
- Global control panel with cross-business analytics
- Real-time metrics: businesses, revenue, orders, drivers
- Business performance summaries
- Recent system activity with severity indicators
- System health monitoring

#### `InfrastructureWarehouseDashboard.tsx`
- Central stock management interface
- Current stock levels with low stock alerts
- Pending allocation approval workflow
- One-click approve & fulfill or reject with reason
- Recent movements tracking

### 5. Database Functions & Triggers

- **`invalidate_user_permissions_cache()`** - Auto-clears cache on role changes

## System Architecture

### Data Flow

```
INFRASTRUCTURE WAREHOUSES (Global Stock Control)
        ↓ (Allocation Request)
BUSINESS WAREHOUSES (Operational Branches)
        ↓ (Driver Loading)
DRIVER VEHICLES (Mobile Inventory)
        ↓ (Order Delivery)
CUSTOMER (Final Destination)
```

Every step is logged in `inventory_movements` with complete traceability.

### Permission Resolution Flow

```
User Login → Get User ID + Business Context
     ↓
Call resolve-permissions Edge Function
     ↓
Merge Base Role + Custom Role Permissions
     ↓
Cache in Database + In-Memory
     ↓
Return to Frontend
     ↓
Inject into JWT for RLS Enforcement
```

### Role Hierarchy

**Infrastructure Level (Hierarchy 1-30)**
1. infrastructure_owner (Full platform access)
10. infrastructure_manager (Audit & support)
15. infrastructure_accountant (Financial oversight)
20. infrastructure_dispatcher (Global routing)
25. infrastructure_warehouse (Stock management)
30. infrastructure_driver (Deliveries)

**Business Level (Hierarchy 100-400)**
100. business_owner (Full business access + financials)
200. business_manager (Operations, no financials)
250. business_dispatcher (Order routing)
275. business_warehouse (Business stock)
300. business_driver (Deliveries)
350. business_sales (Order creation)
400. business_support (Customer service)

- Financial operations get specialized audit
- Cross-scope access flagged for review
- Permission failures logged for threat detection

### 3. Validation Layers
- Database CHECK constraints
- Trigger-based validation
- Edge Function validation
- UI validation

### 4. No Demo Data

## Usage Instructions

### For Infrastructure Owners

**1. Create a Business**
```typescript
const { data, error } = await supabase
  .from('businesses')
  .insert({
    name: 'Business Name',
    business_type: 'logistics',
    active: true,
  });
```

**2. Assign Business Owner**
```typescript
const { data, error } = await supabase
  .from('user_business_roles')
  .insert({
    user_id: userId,
    business_id: businessId,
    role_id: businessOwnerRoleId,
    ownership_percentage: 100,
    is_primary: true,
    assigned_by: auth.uid(),
  });
```

**3. Create Infrastructure Warehouse**
```typescript
const { data, error } = await supabase
  .from('warehouses')
  .insert({
    warehouse_code: 'INFRA-CENTRAL-01',
    warehouse_name: 'Central Infrastructure Warehouse',
    warehouse_type: 'infrastructure_central',
    scope_level: 'infrastructure',
    is_active: true,
    created_by: auth.uid(),
  });
```

**4. Approve Stock Allocation**
```typescript
const { data, error } = await supabase.functions.invoke('approve-allocation', {
  body: {
    allocation_id: '...',
    approved_quantity: 1000,
    action: 'approve',
    auto_fulfill: true,
  },
});
```

### For Business Owners

**1. Request Stock Allocation**
```typescript
const { data, error } = await supabase.functions.invoke('allocate-stock', {
  body: {
    from_warehouse_id: infraWarehouseId,
    to_warehouse_id: businessWarehouseId,
    to_business_id: businessId,
    product_id: productId,
    requested_quantity: 500,
    priority: 'high',
  },
});
```

**2. Customize a Role**
Use the DynamicRoleEditor component:
- Select base role (e.g., manager)
- Click "Create Custom Role"
- Toggle permissions on/off
- Save custom role
- Assign to users

**3. Load Driver Inventory**
```typescript
const { data, error } = await supabase.functions.invoke('load-driver-inventory', {
  body: {
    driver_id: driverId,
    warehouse_id: warehouseId,
    product_id: productId,
    quantity: 100,
    vehicle_identifier: 'VAN-001',
    zone_id: zoneId,
  },
});
```

### For Developers

**Check Permissions in Code**
```typescript
import { hasPermission, hasAnyPermission } from '@/lib/dynamicPermissions';

// Single permission check
const canCreateOrders = await hasPermission(userId, 'orders:create', businessId);

// Multiple permission check
const canManageInventory = await hasAnyPermission(
  userId,
  ['inventory:update', 'inventory:transfer'],
  businessId
);
```

**Render UI Based on Permissions**
```typescript
const permissions = await resolveUserPermissions(userId, businessId);

{hasPermissionSync(permissions, 'financial:view_business_revenue') && (
  <FinancialReportButton />
)}
```
