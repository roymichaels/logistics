if (user?.role === 'owner') {
  return <OwnerDashboard dataStore={dataStore} user={user} onNavigate={onNavigate} />;
}

// Manager gets department-specific dashboard
if (user?.role === 'manager') {
  return <ManagerDashboard dataStore={dataStore} user={user} onNavigate={onNavigate} />;
}

// Other roles continue with existing dashboards
```

### Type System Updates

Updated `data/types.ts` to include:
- `'owner'` role added to User type
- `business_id` field for business association
- `last_active` field for activity tracking

### Data Isolation

- Managers only see their business data
- Owners see all businesses
- Proper filtering in queries
- Business ID scoping

### Audit Trail

- All actions logged
- Actor information captured
- Old/new state tracking
- IP and user agent capture

## üöÄ Deployment Instructions

### 1. Database Schema

Ensure these tables exist:
- `users` - with `role`, `business_id`, `last_active` fields
- `businesses` - for multi-business support
- `user_audit_log` - for activity monitoring
- `partners` - for partner management (optional)
- `notifications` - for notification system

### 2. Environment Variables

Already configured in `.env`:
```
VITE_SUPABASE_URL=your_supabase_url
VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_anon_key
```

### 3. Build and Deploy

```bash
npm run build:web
# Upload dist/ folder to hosting provider
```
