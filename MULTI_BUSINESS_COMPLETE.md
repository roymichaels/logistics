## How Multi-Business Works

### Data Isolation

**Orders:**
- Every order tagged with `business_id`
- Order numbers unique per business (GL-000001 ≠ FH-000001)
- Revenue tracked separately per business
- RLS policies ensure business A cannot see business B's orders

**Products:**
- Same base products (25 cannabis strains)
- Business-specific pricing via `business_products` table:
  - Blue Dream: ₪280 base price
  - Green Leaf sells for ₪336 (+20%)
  - Fast Herbs sells for ₪238 (-15%)
  - Medical Plus sells for ₪280 (regulated standard)
- Business-specific SKUs: GL-BD-001, FH-BD-001, MP-BD-001

**Teams:**
- Users assigned to businesses via `business_users` table
- One user can work for multiple businesses
- Platform owner (Roy Michaels) has access to ALL businesses
- Managers see only their business data
- Sales reps create orders only for their business
- Drivers can be assigned to multiple businesses

**Inventory:**
- Stock tracked per location per business
- Warehouse inventory separated by business
- Driver inventory isolated by business assignment
- Restock requests business-specific

**Revenue:**
- Sales logs tagged with business context
- Dashboard shows per-business metrics
- Commission calculated per business rules
- Export reports filtered by business

## Database Schema (Already Exists!)

### Core Multi-Business Tables

**`businesses`** - Business entities
```sql
- id (uuid)
- name, name_hebrew
- logo_url, primary_color, secondary_color
- order_number_prefix (GL, FH, MP)
- order_number_sequence (auto-increment per business)
- business_settings (jsonb - delivery fees, zones, etc.)
```

**`business_users`** - User→Business assignments
```sql
- business_id (links to business)
- user_id (links to user)
- role (owner, manager, sales, driver, warehouse)
- is_primary (primary business assignment)
- permissions (jsonb - custom permissions)
```

**`business_products`** - Business-specific product pricing
```sql

```

**Extended Tables:**
- `orders.business_id` - Links order to business

### Row Level Security (RLS)

## Key Features Working

✅ **Complete Data Isolation** - Business A cannot access Business B's data via RLS
✅ **Independent Pricing** - Same product, different prices per business
✅ **Separate Order Numbering** - GL-000001, FH-000001, MP-000001
✅ **Business-Specific Teams** - Managers, sales, warehouse per business
✅ **Shared Driver Pool** - Drivers work for multiple businesses
✅ **Per-Business Analytics** - Revenue, orders, performance tracked separately
✅ **Custom Branding** - Each business has own colors, logo, settings
✅ **Business-Specific Rules** - Min order, delivery fee, service zones

---

## Frontend Integration

### Current State:
- Frontend primarily uses `telegram_id` for user identification
- RLS policies automatically filter by business based on `business_users` table
- When user creates order, it's auto-tagged with their primary business_id

### Enhancement Needed (Phase 2):
- Business selector dropdown for platform owner
- Business logo display in navigation
- Business-specific branding colors applied to theme
- Order list shows business tags/filters
- Dashboard aggregates by business

---

## What This Means

**You don't have a single-tenant system.**

You have a **MULTI-TENANT PLATFORM** where:
- Multiple businesses share infrastructure (zones, drivers, warehouse)
- Each business operates independently with own team and pricing
- Complete data isolation via RLS
- Revenue tracked per business
- Scalable to add more businesses without code changes

**Next Step for Full Multi-Tenant:**
- Add business selector UI component
- Show business context in top navigation
- Filter dashboard by selected business
- Add business creation wizard for platform owner
- Implement white-labeling (custom domains, branding)

---
