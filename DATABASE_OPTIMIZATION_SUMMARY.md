#### Foreign Key Validation (via triggers):
- `orders.created_by` → validates user exists
- `orders.assigned_driver` → validates driver exists and is approved
- `tasks.assigned_to` → validates user exists
- `tasks.assigned_by` → validates user exists

#### Data Validation Constraints:
- Order `total_amount` must be non-negative
- Product `price` and `stock_quantity` must be non-negative
- Inventory quantities must be non-negative

- Restock `requested_quantity` must be positive
- Business ownership/commission percentages: 0-100%

#### Business Context Validation:
- Orders validate creator has access to business
- Orders validate assigned driver has access to business
- Enforced via `validate_order_business_context()` trigger

- ✅ **Incremental**: Can be applied one at a time
- ✅ **Data-safe**: Existing data is preserved and migrated
- ✅ **Tested**: Build succeeds with no compilation errors

---

## Usage Examples

### Frontend Integration:

#### 1. Get Dashboard Data:
```typescript
const { data, error } = await supabase.rpc('get_royal_dashboard_snapshot');
```

#### 2. Get Inventory Summary:
```typescript
const { data, error } = await supabase.rpc('get_inventory_balance_summary', {
  p_product_id: productId
});
```

#### 3. Get Zone Coverage:
```typescript
const { data, error } = await supabase.rpc('get_zone_coverage_snapshot', {
  p_zone_id: zoneId // or null for all zones
});
```

#### 4. Get Order Analytics:
```typescript
const { data, error } = await supabase.rpc('get_order_analytics', {
  p_start_date: startDate,
  p_end_date: endDate
});
```

#### 5. Refresh Dashboard Views (admin only):
```typescript
const { error } = await supabase.rpc('refresh_dashboard_views');
```

### Query Patterns:

#### Search users with full-text search:
```sql
SELECT * FROM users
WHERE name % 'search term' -- Uses trigram index
ORDER BY similarity(name, 'search term') DESC;
```

#### Get business members efficiently:
```sql
SELECT u.*
FROM users u
JOIN business_users bu ON u.telegram_id = bu.user_id
WHERE bu.business_id = 'business-uuid'
AND bu.active = true
AND u.registration_status = 'approved';
```

#### Check low stock with indexed query:
```sql
SELECT *
FROM inventory_records
WHERE on_hand_quantity <= low_stock_threshold; -- Uses partial index
```

## Monitoring & Maintenance

### Materialized View Refresh:
- **Manual refresh**: Call `refresh_dashboard_views()` or `refresh_inventory_views()`
- **Automated refresh**: Set up cron job or pg_cron extension
- **Trigger-based**: Listen to `dashboard_refresh_needed` notification channel

### Recommended Refresh Schedule:
- **Dashboard metrics**: Every 5 minutes
- **Revenue trends**: Every 15 minutes
- **Inventory summary**: Every 30 minutes
- **Driver performance**: Every 5 minutes
- **Zone coverage**: Every 5 minutes

### Index Maintenance:
```sql
-- Check index usage
SELECT schemaname, tablename, indexname, idx_scan
FROM pg_stat_user_indexes
ORDER BY idx_scan ASC;

-- Rebuild indexes if needed
REINDEX TABLE users;
REINDEX TABLE orders;
```

### Performance Monitoring:
```sql
-- Check materialized view size
SELECT schemaname, matviewname,
       pg_size_pretty(pg_total_relation_size(schemaname||'.'||matviewname))
FROM pg_matviews;

-- Check view last refresh
SELECT * FROM mv_dashboard_metrics;
-- Look at last_updated column
```

## Breaking Changes & Migration Notes

### User Registration Flow:
- **Old**: Separate `user_registrations` table
- **New**: Integrated into `users` table with `registration_status` field
- **Migration**: Automatically merges both tables, preserves all data

### Business Context:
- **New**: `business_id` added to tenant-scoped tables
- **Impact**: Existing rows have NULL business_id (considered global/platform-level)
- **Action**: Populate business_id for existing data if needed

### RLS Policy Changes:
- **Stricter**: Business context isolation now enforced
- **Impact**: Users without business assignment may have restricted access
- **Action**: Ensure all users are properly assigned to businesses

---

## Rollback Procedures

### If migrations need rollback:

#### Rollback Migration 3 (Security):
```sql
-- Drop new policies and constraints
-- Restore original policies
-- Remove business_id columns (data loss!)
```

#### Rollback Migration 2 (Views):
```sql
-- Drop materialized views
DROP MATERIALIZED VIEW mv_dashboard_metrics CASCADE;
DROP MATERIALIZED VIEW mv_revenue_trend_hourly CASCADE;
DROP MATERIALIZED VIEW mv_inventory_summary CASCADE;
DROP MATERIALIZED VIEW mv_driver_performance CASCADE;
DROP MATERIALIZED VIEW mv_zone_coverage CASCADE;

-- Drop functions
DROP FUNCTION get_royal_dashboard_snapshot() CASCADE;
-- ... etc
```

#### Rollback Migration 1 (Users):
```sql
-- Restore user_registrations table from backup
CREATE TABLE user_registrations AS
SELECT * FROM users WHERE registration_status = 'pending';

-- Restore old users table structure (data loss!)
```

**Note**: Rollbacks should be carefully planned as they may result in data loss.

---

## Next Steps

### 1. Deploy Migrations:
```bash
# Using Supabase CLI
supabase db push

# Or apply manually via Supabase Dashboard
# Copy migration files to Dashboard → SQL Editor
```

### 2. Verify Deployment:
```sql
-- Check users table structure
\d users

-- Check materialized views exist
SELECT * FROM pg_matviews WHERE schemaname = 'public';

-- Test functions
SELECT get_royal_dashboard_snapshot();
```

### 3. Update Frontend Code:
- Use new consolidated `users` table
- Call database functions instead of complex queries
- Update UserManagement component to use new structure

### 4. Performance Testing:
- Load test dashboard queries
- Monitor materialized view refresh time
- Verify index usage with EXPLAIN ANALYZE

### 5. Set Up Monitoring:
- Configure view refresh schedule
- Set up alerts for slow queries
- Monitor index bloat
