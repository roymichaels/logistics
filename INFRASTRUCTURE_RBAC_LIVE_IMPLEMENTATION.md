## 1. Database Enhancements

### Financial Tables Created

#### `business_revenue`
- Tracks revenue by business with complete audit trail
- Supports multiple revenue sources (orders, services, other)
- Includes gross and net amounts with currency support
- RLS policies enforce infrastructure and business owner access only

#### `business_costs`
- Tracks costs by business and category
- Categories: inventory, labor, delivery, overhead, marketing, other
- Vendor and reference number tracking for reconciliation
- Scoped RLS for infrastructure accountants and business owners

#### `profit_distributions`
- Manages profit distribution calculations and payments
- Workflow: calculated → approved → processing → completed
- Stores distribution details per owner with ownership percentages
- Complete audit trail of approvals and completions

### Helper Functions

```sql
-- Calculate profit distribution based on ownership
calculate_profit_distribution(business_id UUID, net_profit NUMERIC)
  RETURNS TABLE(user_id, user_name, ownership_pct, distribution_amount)

-- Quick permission check
user_has_permission_check(user_id UUID, permission_key TEXT, business_id UUID)
  RETURNS BOOLEAN
```

### Validation Enhancements

- **Warehouse allocation flow validation**: Prevents business → infrastructure reverse flows
- **Equity distribution tracking**: Framework for validating 100% ownership totals
- **Business scope enforcement**: Ensures proper business_id assignment

---

## 2. Edge Functions Deployed

### `business-context-switch`
**Purpose:** Allows multi-business users to switch active business context

**Endpoints:** POST `/functions/v1/business-context-switch`

**Features:**
- Validates user has access to target business
- Updates user_business_contexts table with active business
- Invalidates permission cache for clean context switch
- Logs context switch in system audit log
- Returns business details for UI update

**Security:**
- JWT verification required
- Cross-business access validation
- Audit trail for all switches

---

### `deliver-order`
**Purpose:** Driver order delivery with automatic inventory decrement

**Endpoints:** POST `/functions/v1/deliver-order`

**Features:**
- Validates driver assignment to order
- Auto-decrements driver vehicle inventory per item
- Logs inventory movements with complete audit trail
- Updates order status to "delivered"
- Records proof of delivery (photo URL, GPS location)
- Handles partial inventory scenarios gracefully

**Inventory Logic:**
1. Verifies driver has sufficient quantity for each product
2. Decrements `current_quantity` in `driver_vehicle_inventory`
3. Reduces `reserved_quantity` if applicable
4. Creates `inventory_movements` record (type: delivery_fulfillment)
5. Logs driver movement in `driver_movement_logs`
6. Captures delivery results per item in order metadata

---

### `role-editor`
**Purpose:** Dynamic role customization for business owners

**Endpoints:**
- GET `/functions/v1/role-editor?business_id={id}` - List custom roles
- POST `/functions/v1/role-editor` - Create custom role
- PUT `/functions/v1/role-editor` - Update role permissions

**Features:**
- List all custom roles with permissions for a business
- Create custom roles based on base roles (e.g., clone "manager")
- Enable/disable permissions granularly by permission key
- Validate business owner access before modifications
- Invalidate permission cache for affected users
- Log all role changes in role_change_log
- Version tracking for custom role changes

**Permission Model:**
- Base roles define the maximum permission scope
- Custom roles can disable (but not enable new) permissions
- Business-level roles can be customized (`can_be_customized = true`)
- Infrastructure roles cannot be customized (system-controlled)

---

## 4. Permission System Architecture

### Infrastructure-First Hierarchy

```
Infrastructure Owner (Global)
  ├─ Full access to all businesses and infrastructure
  ├─ Can create businesses and assign equity
  └─ Manages infrastructure warehouses and stock

Infrastructure Manager (Global Read + Support Override)
  ├─ Read access across all businesses for audit
  ├─ Temporary write access with support_override flag
  └─ All actions logged in cross_scope_access_log

Infrastructure Dispatcher (Global)
  ├─ Manage and assign all orders platform-wide
  ├─ Plan routes for all drivers
  └─ View all inventory for allocation planning

Infrastructure Warehouse (Infrastructure Stock Control)
  ├─ Full CRUD on infrastructure warehouses
  ├─ Approve stock allocations to businesses
  ├─ Manage capacity limits and reconciliation

Infrastructure Accountant (Financial Oversight)
  ├─ View financial data across all businesses
  ├─ Generate cross-business reports
  └─ Manage profit distributions and equity transfers

Business Owner (Business Scope)
  ├─ Full access within their business only
  ├─ View and manage financial data (revenue, costs, profit)
  ├─ Assign roles and manage team members
  ├─ Create and customize business-level roles
  └─ Manage ownership distribution

Business Manager (Operations)
  ├─ Daily operations without financial visibility
  ├─ Assign drivers and dispatch orders
  ├─ Coordinate warehouse and delivery staff
  └─ Cannot view profit or ownership details

Sales / Support (Limited Scope)
  ├─ Sales: Create orders, view inventory availability
  ├─ Support: Search orders, update status, customer communication
  └─ No financial or team management access
```

### Permission Resolution Flow

1. **User Authentication** → JWT with user_id
2. **Business Context** → active_business_id from user_business_contexts
3. **Role Lookup** → Check user_business_roles for role_id or custom_role_id
4. **Permission Merge** → Combine base role + custom role permissions
5. **Cache Check** → Use user_permissions_cache if < 5 minutes old
6. **Authorization** → hasPermission(permission_key) → Allow/Deny

---

## 5. Inventory Pipeline (Live Data Flow)

### Stock Allocation Workflow

```
Infrastructure Warehouse (Source)
         ↓ [Allocation Request]
Infrastructure Approval
         ↓ [Approved]
Business Warehouse (Destination)
         ↓ [Driver Loading]
Driver Vehicle Inventory
         ↓ [Delivery]
Customer (Order Fulfilled)
```

### Key Tables

- **warehouses**: scope_level (infrastructure | business)
- **stock_allocations**: Tracks allocation_status workflow
- **driver_vehicle_inventory**: current_quantity, reserved_quantity
- **inventory_movements**: Immutable audit trail (from/to locations)
- **warehouse_capacity_limits**: Prevents over-allocation

### Movement Types

- `infrastructure_allocation` - Infrastructure → Business
- `business_transfer` - Business → Business (rare, requires approval)
- `driver_loading` - Warehouse → Driver Vehicle
- `delivery_fulfillment` - Driver → Customer (auto via deliver-order)
- `return_to_warehouse` - Driver → Warehouse (damaged/undelivered)
- `adjustment` - Manual correction (audited)

---

## 6. Financial Data Isolation

### RLS Enforcement

**Infrastructure Roles (Global Visibility):**
- infrastructure_owner
- infrastructure_accountant
- infrastructure_manager (read-only)

**Business Roles (Scoped Visibility):**
- business_owner: Can view/record revenue and costs for their business
- manager: Can record costs but NOT view revenue or profit

**Access Patterns:**
```sql
-- Infrastructure can view all
WHERE role IN ('infrastructure_owner', 'infrastructure_accountant')

-- Business owners see own business only
WHERE business_id IN (
  SELECT business_id FROM user_business_roles
  WHERE user_id = auth.uid() AND role_key = 'business_owner'
)
```

### Financial Operations

1. **Revenue Recording:**
   - Daily revenue by source (orders, services, other)
   - Links to order_ids for reconciliation
   - Recorded by business_owner or infrastructure

2. **Cost Tracking:**
   - Categorized costs (inventory, labor, delivery, overhead, marketing)
   - Vendor and reference tracking
   - Recorded by warehouse, manager, or owner

3. **Profit Distribution:**
   - Calculate: net_profit = total_revenue - total_costs
   - Distribute based on ownership_percentage
   - Workflow: calculated → approved → completed
   - Distributions stored in JSONB with user_id + amount

---

## 7. Audit and Compliance

### Audit Tables

- **system_audit_log**: Master log for all events
- **financial_audit_log**: Specialized tracking for financial ops
- **cross_scope_access_log**: Infrastructure manager overrides
- **role_change_log**: Complete role and permission changes
- **equity_transfer_log**: Ownership transfers
- **business_lifecycle_log**: Business creation/modification

### Logged Events

- User role assignments and changes
- Permission modifications (base and custom roles)
- Business context switches
- Financial data access (who viewed what and when)
- Inventory movements (every transfer logged)
- Order status changes and deliveries
- Cross-scope access by infrastructure managers

---

## 8. Security Model

### JWT Claims Structure

```json
{
  "sub": "user_id",
  "role": "infrastructure_owner",
  "business_id": "active_business_id",
  "permissions": [
    "orders:view_all_infrastructure",
    "inventory:update",
    "financial:view_all_infrastructure"
  ],
  "can_see_financials": true,
  "can_see_cross_business": true,
  "support_override": {
    "enabled": false,
    "expires_at": null,
    "reason": null
  }
}
```

### Security Layers

1. **Authentication**: Telegram TWA or Email/Password via Supabase Auth
2. **JWT Verification**: All Edge Functions verify JWT tokens
3. **RLS Policies**: Database-level enforcement of access rules
4. **Permission Checks**: Application-level permission validation
5. **Audit Logging**: All actions tracked with actor and timestamp
