## Overview

Successfully implemented a comprehensive order workflow system with driver zone assignment, automatic notifications, and integrated chat functionality for seamless communication between managers, drivers, and customers.

## Key Features Implemented

### 1. Driver Zone Assignment System ✅

**Location:** `pages/ZoneManagement.tsx`

#### Features:
- ✅ **Zone-based driver management** - Assign drivers to specific delivery zones
- ✅ **Multi-driver per zone** - Multiple drivers can cover the same zone
- ✅ **Active/inactive assignments** - Toggle driver availability by zone
- ✅ **Real-time zone coverage** - See which zones have available drivers
- ✅ **Driver unassignment** - Remove drivers from zones when needed
- ✅ **Royal purple theme** with smooth animations

#### Workflow:
```
1. Manager creates delivery zones (Downtown, North, South, etc.)
2. Manager assigns drivers to specific zones
3. System tracks active assignments
4. When order comes in, system matches order location to zone
5. Only drivers assigned to that zone are shown as candidates
```

### 2. Order-to-Driver Assignment with Zone Matching ✅

**Location:** `pages/Orders.tsx` - OrderDetail component

- ✅ **Inventory checking** - Verify driver has required products in stock

### 6. Role-Based Order Visibility

**Security & Privacy:**

```typescript
// Owner/Manager: See ALL orders
filteredOrders = allOrders

// Sales: Only see orders THEY created
filteredOrders = allOrders.filter(o => 
  o.created_by === currentUser.telegram_id
)

// Driver: Only see orders ASSIGNED to them
filteredOrders = allOrders.filter(o => 
  o.assigned_driver === currentUser.telegram_id
)

// Warehouse: NO ACCESS to orders page
filteredOrders = []
```

## Technical Implementation

### Database Schema

**zones table:**
```sql
id, name, color, active, created_at
```

**driver_zone_assignments table:**
```sql
id, driver_telegram_id, zone_id, active, assigned_at
```

**orders table (enhanced):**
```sql
id, customer_name, customer_address,
assigned_driver, status, zone_id,
created_by, created_at, items, total_amount
```

**notifications table:**
```sql
id, recipient_id, title, message, type,
read, read_at, action_url, metadata, created_at
```

### DataStore Methods Used

```typescript
// Zone Management
listZones()
assignDriverToZone(driverId, zoneId)
unassignDriverFromZone(driverId, zoneId)

// Order Management
listOrders(filters)
updateOrder(orderId, updates)
getOrder(orderId)

// Notifications
createNotification(input)
listNotifications(filters)

## UI Enhancements

### Order Detail Page Components:

**1. Assigned Driver Card:**
```
┌─────────────────────────────────────┐
│ 🚚 נהג משויך                        │
├─────────────────────────────────────┤
│ שם הנהג                             │
│ telegram_id                         │
