  # Militarized RLS - Strict Role Enforcement

  This migration hardens Row Level Security policies to enforce strict role-based sandboxes.
  Each role can ONLY access the data they need. Zero overlap. Full isolation.

  ## Changes

  1. **Sales Role Restrictions**
     - Can ONLY view orders they created
     - Can view inventory (read-only)
     - CANNOT modify inventory
     - Can request restocks but not approve them

  2. **Warehouse Role Restrictions**
     - CANNOT access orders table at all
     - Full access to inventory operations
     - Can approve/fulfill restock requests
     - All movements logged

  3. **Driver Role Restrictions**
     - Can ONLY view orders assigned to them
     - Can ONLY see their own inventory
     - Can ONLY see their assigned zones
     - CANNOT see other drivers' data

  4. **User Role Restrictions**
     - No access to operational data
     - Read-only profile access
     - Must request manager promotion via PIN

  5. **Owner/Manager Exceptions**
     - Full access to all data within their business context
     - Cross-business access for platform owner only
